# Marketing Campaign AI Optimizer

### Brief Description

- The solution is disected on the 'solution.ipynb' file where all the steps to reach the optimal model are depicted and analysed.
Also there is the data analysis done beforehand and the final conclusion comparing every model trained.

- In the 'final_model.py', the final model chosen in the 'solution.ipynb' conclusion is implemented. In this little script one can train the model and make predictions filling the data array.

- The 'lib_installer.py' is a tiny script that check if all the dependencies required for the project are installed and if not they get installed automatically.

- The dataset is stored on a 'dataset' directory with 'train.csv' and 'test.csv' as datasets names.

### Functionality

In the 'solution.ipynb' the following steps are taken:
 - Analisys of the data: The data is encoded in numerical values for further treatment and properly displayed for easy readability.
 - Next we proceed with a deeper analisys of the profiles encountered to properly understand the final results.
 - Once the data is understood, some AI models are tested to classify the data into two groups: potential buyers and none valid.
 - Lastly the results of the different models are compared to choose the best performing one regarding precision and time efficiency. 

*Disclaimer: All the data used in the models are fake and not representative of the real world. All the conclusions drawn from the project are based on the dataset itself making them invalid for real world applications.*
